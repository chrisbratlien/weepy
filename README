Weepy is a small PHP framework which borrows some idioms from WordPress such as:

add_action
do_action
add_filter
apply_filters

get_header
get_footer

Some files are also organized in a style similar to a WordPress theme:

functions.php
header.php
footer.php

INSTALLATION

1) copy local.php.sample to local.php. Change the path in base_uri and get_bloginfo to match your desired URL path (top of domain or subfolder).

Make site-specific changes in local.php

2) copy .htaccess.sample to .htaccess  Edit the RewriteBase line to be / or /yoursubfolder

3) Start making your own pages. 

http://your-url => home.php
http://your-url/example => page-example.php  (example.php will also work)
